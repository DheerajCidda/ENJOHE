Healthcare Engineering Short Courses (HESC)
Background: Engineers are in high demand in healthcare, but most engineers do not have sufficient knowledge to serve in healthcare, because most engineering curricula do not cover healthcare, except Biomedical Engineering. However, besides Biomedical Engineering, healthcare industry is in need of engineers in almost all the other engineering disciplines, particularly Chemical, Computer, Electrical, Environmental, Industrial, Information, Materials, Mechanical, Software, and Systems Engineering. The Healthcare Engineering Short Courses is designed to bridge the gap.

Goal: The goal of Healthcare Engineering Short Courses (HESC) is to prepare course takers for engineering jobs in healthcare.

Objectives: This short course program is designed to achieve the following:

Course taker learns only cutting-edge engineering/technology knowledge that the healthcare industry employers immediately need.
Course taker determines the course topic, objective(s), and scope based on his/her own background and interest, as well as current trends of healthcare engineering/technology and needs of employers.
Upon completion of the course, course taker is uniquely qualified and becomes an excellent fit for particular target jobs.
Course taker can tailor the short course scope to exactly fit a job description; then start and finish the course before the application deadline.
Rationale: Development of courses in healthcare engineering is very challenging due to the following:

Since healthcare engineering is a rapidly progressing field, it is very difficult to offer courses that guarantee to cover updated knowledge on cutting-edge topics.
Since healthcare engineering is an immensely broad field, it is very difficult to offer courses that guarantee to cover all important topics of current interest to the healthcare industry.
As a highly interdisciplinary field, healthcare engineering covers topics that draw interest and contributions from a wide spectrum of background and specialty. For instance, the topic of Artificial Intelligence for Breast Cancer Diagnosis may be of interest to engineers, scientists, and healthcare professionals in Biomedical Engineering, Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Data Science, Electrical Engineering, Oncology, Pathology, Radiology, etc. It is very difficult to develop a course on a particular topic to accommodate course takers of varied background and specialty.
We address the above issues by developing a short course format that allows each course taker to develop his/her own course topic, objective(s) and scope, and select most recent refereed archival journal articles based on personal background, interest, and career prospects. Each course taker needs to pass a test particularly developed by our Advisory Committee, along with the authors of the articles, to test the student’s understanding of those articles.

Who should take the course: HESC are designed for

Engineers and students from all engineering disciplines such as Biological, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Environmental, Industrial, Information, Materials, Mechanical, Software, and Systems Engineering, who are interested in serving the healthcare industry.
Healthcare professionals such as physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, allied health professionals, health/medical scientists and students who are interested in extending their specialties to Healthcare Engineering.
Procedure:

Student contacts HESC@gmail.com, register, and pays the course fee to start. Course can start anytime.
Student determines the topic and scope of a course in Healthcare Engineering based on personal interest, background/experience, and career goal. (Refer to general topics of Healthcare Engineering and engineering jobs in healthcare.)
The advisory committee approves the course topic and scope.
Student collects at least 30 most recent journal papers related to the topic from the literature database of National Library of Medicine at www.PubMed.gov . This database is the most authoritative medical literature database in the world, and includes only peer-reviewed, archival journal papers. Additional papers from other literature sources can be included after these 30 most recent papers from PubMed are in place.
The advisory committee approves the list of selected papers.
Student studies the papers at his/her own pace (typically in one to three months). Help is available from the Advisory Committee.
Advisory Committee, along with authors of the papers, prepares a test for the materials covered in the papers.
Student takes the test any time when he/she is ready. Test format: open book (and notes, papers, Internet, etc.), online, 60 minutes. Each test is uniquely developed for a student to test the student’s understanding of the papers selected by the student him/herself; no second student takes the same test.
Advisory committee decides outcome (pass/fail) of the test.
In case of failure, student can retake the test multiple times (with different test problems, and paying additional fee for each repeated test) at any time until passing.
The set of selected papers needs to be updated every 6 months if the student does not pass the test within such timeframe, and students will study and take a test for the new set of papers. Procedure then starts from step 4.
Student can change course topic and scope any time. Procedure then starts from step 2.
A certificate is issued to student stipulating passing the course of a certain topic (e.g., Artificial Intelligence for Medical Devices) at a certain date.
Course of the same topic may be repeated if significant advances in the field have been demonstrated by the new papers published, true for most of the topics in Healthcare Engineering. Procedure starts from step 1.
